I totally winged this and then came out with some fantastic fajitas so I want to write it down before I forget.

### Ingredients
- Ribeye steak, thinly sliced (around 8oz per person)
- Bell peppers
- Other peppers, I like to add some anaheim or jalapeno peppers for some kick
- Sweet onion
- Limes, around 1 per ribeye
- Minced garlic (fresh or from a jar)
- Worchestershire sauce
- Olive oil
- Chili powder
- Tortillas
- Fixin's (cheese, sour cream, hot sauce, etc.)
### Tools
- A grill
- [Veggie grilling basket](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B000WEIJUW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- Large ziplock bags
- Aluminum Foil

### Directions
1. Juice the limes into a pyrex or something with a spout
2. Add some worchestershire, garlic, and chili powder
3. Slap your ribeyes into a large ziplock bag and add the sauce along with a few glugs of olive oil
4. Seal it up and let it sit for a few hours in the fridge
5. Fire up that grill (don't forget your grilling basket)
6. Slice the peppers and onions into thin, long strands
7. Toss the peppers and onions in a large mixing bowl with some olive oil, salt, and chili powder
8. Spread your veggies onto the grill inside the basket, and slap those steaks on the grill as well
9. Cook it!  And don't burn it!
10. Ok, now when you're nearing cooking completion, grab your tortillas.  Take like 2-3 of them at a time and lay them into some aluminim foil.  Roll up the tortillas and foil together, then set that on a cooler part of the grill to warm them up.  This really takes it to the next level.
11. Pull it all off, slice the steaks real thin, and serve it up!
