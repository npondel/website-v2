Everyone needs a good chili recipe.  *Someone* in my house hates beans, so Texas chili it is!  This is heavily inspired by [this recipe](https://www.southernliving.com/recipes/west-texas-chili-recipe).  It usually comes out about "medium" spiciness, very thick, and very filling thanks to all the beef involved.
