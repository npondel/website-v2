Yes, yes I know this is far from what you'd find over in the UK, but it's my own delicious (Winsconsin-y) take on this classic.

### Ingredients
- Bangers
  - If you can find a fairly mild pork or beef sausage, that's probably your best bet
  - Living in Wisconsin, usually what I have nearby is a ton of bratwurst, so I usually go for a mild, garlic-y brat.
- Potatoes, get a few of em
- Canned french onion soup, condensed version!
- Stick of salted butter
- A small amount of milk
- Minced garlic, fresh or from the jar
- A high smoke point cooking oil

### Tools
- Large pot and small pot
- A frying pan that you can put in the oven
- Potato masher
- Heat-resistant gloves

### Directions
- Start oven for 325 so it preheats
- Fill the large pot with water and start on high heat
  - Add the potatoes to the water
- Once at a rolling boil, drop heat to med and simmer (nearly boiling)
  - Set a timer for 20mins for the potatoes
- Add oil to frying pan and start on high heat
- Once hot, add sausage and cook until browned (just brown em, we're not cooking them on the stove top)
- Once browned, toss the entire pan into the oven
- Pour the french onion soup into the small pot (DO NOT ADD ANY WATER, just used it condensed)
  - Heat on med-low heat, just until hot
- Pull out sausage pan from the oven (check temp for 165 or so)
  - Use grilling gloves and/or multiple oven mits
  - Leave a silicone grip or towel on the handle so you remember it's hot (learn from my pain)
- Drain the potatoes and kill the heat
- Mash potatoes a bit, add stick of butter, minced garlic, and a splash of milk
  - Keep mashing and then stirring
- Serve
  - Splat the potatoes on the plate, make a divot for the soup, ladel soup in, then lay sausage on top
