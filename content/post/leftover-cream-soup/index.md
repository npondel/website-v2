This came out of us having a 20-something pound turkey for Thanksgiving and 2 adults plus one chihuahua to eat it.  

Basically, when you cook a turkey, a chicken, or anything similar really, always seal up the remaining meat in a ziplock (or preferably a vacuum sealed bag), then freeze it.  When you're ready, you can make a delicious leftovers soup.

### Ingredients
All of these ingredients are plus or minus a bit.  This is a very loose recipie.
- 1-2lb of leftover turkey or chicken
- handful of whole, raw carrots
- handful of whole celery
- smaller onion
- can of sweet corn
- other veggies you may desire
- 1 carton of chicken broth
- 1 small (8oz or so) carton of heavy whipping cream
- some milk
- salt and pepper
- Goya Sazon seasoning (eliminate if you're afraid of MSG)
- white wine

### Instructions
- Thaw that meat the night before by leaving it in the fridge
- Grab the biggest stock pot you have and start it on medium heat
- Add the chicken stock, heavy cream, and a hearty splash of white wine to the pot
- Peel/chop the veggies and add them to the pot, along with the corn from the can
- Add the meat
- Add a healthy amount of salt, pepper, and one packet of the Goya seasoning
- Simmer for around 30-45 mins
- After simmering for a while, it needs some thickening to finish it off
  - Take a small bowl and add about 1/2 cup of flour to it
  - Add in milk slowly while whisking until it's the consistency of pancake batter
  - Add this slurry to the soup and stir, this should thicken things nicely
  - Do it again if you want some thicc soup
  - If you overdo it, add some more white wine or a little water
- I like to serve this with some simple crescent rolls (the tube ones)
