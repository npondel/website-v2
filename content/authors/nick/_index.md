Client Systems Engineer at Epic.  Professional work is primarily supporting hospital IT staff with the Epic software stack on Windows desktop and server operating systems.  Expertise in Citrix Virtual Apps and VMware Horizon Apps.  Experience debugging systems with Process Monitor, Wireshark, Fiddler, and more.  Special interests in IT security, web browser technologies, and data analytics.

In my spare time, I enjoy:
- Unraid, Docker, and Raspberry Pis
- League of Legends and CS:GO
- Electric instruments
- Photography
- Making coffee, cocktails, and sometimes food

A lot of this blog is going to be me documenting weird computer things and/or recipies that I don't want to forget.
