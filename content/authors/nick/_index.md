Currently a Client Systems Engineer at Epic.  In my professional work, I support hospital SysAdmins that work on the "presentation tier" including published applications and virtual desktops infrastructure.  Outside of that core role, I also work on troubleshooting networking issues, web browser technologies, and some development.  My dev work is primarily focused on PowerShell and R for automation and analytics.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing with:
- Unraid
- Docker containers
- Raspberry Pis (Octopi/PiHole)
- 3D printers
- Synths/electric instruments
